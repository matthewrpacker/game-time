##### About UFO
<br>
<strong>UFO</strong> is a single-player, side scroller, 2D collision-detection game wherein a player controls a UFO using the spacebar to 'ascend' and 'descend' in order to avoid colliding with oncoming astroids. Upon impact with an asteroid the game is over.

Progress is measured in distance (parsecs). Points increase based on distance traveled. A player can collide with bonus objects, represented by stars, and increase the score. Every 500 points the level increases along with speed, making the game more challenging.

In order to win the game a player must complete all 7 levels and earn 4000 points. To date this has never happened...
